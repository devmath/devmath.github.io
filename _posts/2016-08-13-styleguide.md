intro: Do you know the why about write a style guide?
---

Hey!

Some time ago, I did a simple style guide, following some cool rules. Those rules I use and I will use.

# About writing your own style guide

Do you know the why about write a style guide?

It's simple. Imagine you have(or make part of) a developer team. Imagine you will to build a super cool front end project, but, each one always worked alone, without a team or whatever is. And too, each one work with a different framework and most different coding styles. How you'll do? Declare a framework and go ahead?

If everyone had some rules to follow(until with some framework)? It would be better, no?

Lastly, [I have a style guide here and you can copy or do whatever you want with him](https://github.com/devmath/my-own-styleguide). It's just my style guide, I wrote this based on others style guides.
