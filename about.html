		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>So, let's go.</p>
		<p>First of everything, my name is Matheus and I'm from Brazil, Earth.</p>
		<p>I have 17 years and I'm a tech lover since kid.</p>
		<p>I started into tech world, because my brother. He knew how to fix computers and do some cool things on computer, and it inspired me to do the same. With 9 years, I used an app to create - or try to create - a simple game. After, at around my 13 or 14 years, I entered in a course about computer maintenance and other about using Windows Seven.</p>
		<p>I left the courses, because I was thinking this was awful for my time.</p>
		<p>Strangely, at same time on my life, I started to valorize my time, as if he was precious like gold</p>
		<p>Around october/2013, I started learn how to use Photoshop, Illustrator and some others things about graphic design. I confess, sometimes I tried learn about HTML and CSS, but, I couldn't because I was very lazy.</p>
		<p>Around january/2014 I started learn a lot of things about front-end.</p>
		<p>At january of this year I started learn about back-end side, like PHP, MySQL, and others things - oh, I also started to use definetely the Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>I am currently working on <a href="http://www.gasoline-digital.com/" target="_blank">Gasoline Digital</a>, is an awesome place.</p>
		<p>Now, I'm learning about JavaScript deeply - I think.</p>
